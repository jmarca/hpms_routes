# Select HPMS segments, data

This is a library for express app to facilitate fetching and
displaying HPMS segments using the PostGIS database.

Currently it will only work with the older style geolocating database.

# web viewer

The purpose of this was originally to facilitate the visualization of
the progress in geocoding HPMS assets.  Now that CT is delivering HPMS
with geocode information already included, this library will
eventually become just a way to display via the web.
